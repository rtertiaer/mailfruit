## TODO
This is a work in progress. Roadmap:
- AppArmor profiles (except debian might already do this for us :thinking:)
- Split out mta & mda roles for scalability
- Webmail client
- HA - multiple servers of each role
- Better tooling for adding users (very simple script now)
- Better spam monitoring
